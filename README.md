#HTML is a language to learn if anyone wants to work in the web development domain [Web designers, Web Developers]. 
HTML alone is not sufficient for a web developer because HTML only defines the structure of the data that will be rendered on the browser in a webpage, 
to make it visually appealing and to make it functional, we will need to use CSS and Javascript as well.


#Tags, Attributes and Elements
Tags are the primary component of the HTML that defines how the content will be structured/ formatted, 
whereas Attributes are used along with the HTML tags to define the characteristics of the element. 

For example, <p align=” center”>Interview questions</p>, in this the ‘align’ is the attribute using which
will align the paragraph to show in the center of the view.



HTML elements are defined by a starting tag, may contain some content and a closing tag.
HTML elements which do not have closing tags or do not need to be closed are Void elements. For Example <br />, <img />, <hr />, etc.
